# Artifical Neural Networks Lectures Notes

We try to model machine learning the way the brain tries to learn. The brain has a visual and a motor cortex and a frontal cortex. The visual cortex is at the back of the head, the comparison is done at the fron of the head. Movements of the arms are controlled by the motor cortex above the ears. In one cubic milimeter there are 10'000 neurons and 3 km of wire. Signals are transmitted through axons. The neurons connect with synapses, or contact points on the dendritic tree. The responses add up when several spikes come to the neuron. If the summed response reaches a threshold value then this neuron sends out a spike to yet other neurons. All learning is a change of weights. 

The activity of the output is :

Where here above the x_i is the output in the neuron i and the w_{ik} are the weights from node k to node i, and x_k are the input weights of node k.
