# Notes from the Exercises 

**04 : Scaling up**

You can import the different libraries under a different name using a smaller shortened form for example pd for panda. Then if you want to use the Python Spark common library PySpark you need to create a context as follows :

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

from pyspark.sql import *
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
from pyspark import SparkContext

# create the session
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

# create the context
sc = spark.sparkContext
```
You can then import the json file and use it with the spark framework as follows : `spark.read.json("text.txt")`. You can print the schema as `printSchema()`, you can `take()` and `show()`. When you want to for example print a statement you can use special formatting with variables as follows :

```
print("In total there are {0} operations".format(Bombing_Operations.count()))
```

Consider the following code below. Here you have the json data which you group according to a certai category, in each category you aggreggate all the data and gives it a new name and sort in the descending order where here you use the alias of the column.

```
missions_counts = Bombing_Operations.groupBy("ContryFlyingMission")\
                                    .agg(count("*").alias("MissionsCount"))\
                                    .sort(desc("MissionsCount"))
missions_counts.show()
```
However if you want to write everything in terms of SQL then you can transform the json file into a temporary table and perform a query on it using the sql function of the Spark library : 

```
Bombing_Operations.registerTempTable("Bombing_Operations")

query = """
SELECT ContryFlyingMission, count(*) as MissionsCount
FROM Bombing_Operations
GROUP BY ContryFlyingMission
ORDER BY MissionsCount DESC
"""

missions_counts = spark.sql(query)
missions_counts.show()
```
Then you can move the data to pandas as follows : 

```
missions_count_pd = missions_counts.toPandas()
missions_count_pd.head()
```
Now using the Pandas library you may now plot the data in the library as follows : 

```

pl = missions_count_pd.plot(kind="bar", 
                            x="ContryFlyingMission", y="MissionsCount", 
                            figsize=(10, 7), log=True, alpha=0.5, color="olive")
pl.set_xlabel("Country")
pl.set_ylabel("Number of Missions (Log scale)")
pl.set_title("Number of missions by contry")
```
You may apply some expressions on the data before you select it. Consider below where we had already selected the json file and then you run the `selectExpr` command on it. Then you convert the column of MissionDate to a date before giving it the same alias, and you also select the country where the mission was held. All this is in quotes which are doubel quotes and within square brackets. 

```
missions_countries = Bombing_Operations.selectExpr(["to_date(MissionDate) as MissionDate", "ContryFlyingMission"])
missions_countries
```
you can also group by several categories as seen below. These are separated with commas and with double quotes as follows :

```
missions_by_date = missions_countries\
                    .groupBy(["MissionDate", "ContryFlyingMission"])\
                    .agg(count("*").alias("MissionsCount"))\
                    .sort(asc("MissionDate")).toPandas()
missions_by_date.head()
```
