In the basic exercise of the modularity example, we want to modularize the code and create separate methods to compute various parts rather than one big method. First of all we have a main method defined as follows `  public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { compute(); }`. In this main method we are calling another method called compute, which will do other calculations. Then in this computer method we actually return a listof Doubles. Here all operations are in separate methods.

We have in the LoadFromFile method that we instantiate a new file using the given filepath. Then we need to create a scanner that depends on the file at hand. This scanner checks whether the file has a double and if so returns this double. We use the following methods `scanner.hadNextDouble()` and `scanner.nextDouble()`. When you stop using the scanner you need to close the scanner `scanner.close()`. You can iterate over a list of doubles as follows : `for (double d: list) {}`. You can convert a double n to a string by writing `Double.toString(n)`.
